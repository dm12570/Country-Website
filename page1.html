<h3>
    <p>
        This bird is called the "Rhea" bird. It is the second largest flightless bird <br>
        that is native to South America. This bird has survived due to its running speed <br>
        of 31 mph or around 50 kph. People usually hunt them most of there bodies, their <br>
        feathers for feather dusters, there skin for leather or cloaks, and their meat for <br>
        decent meals.
